#Learning activities and resources
This week, I focused on a sub-theme related to HTML and how to design and publish websites. I set up a sub-theme, specifically about designing websites and making them accessible online. After completing practical exercises, I also explored YouTube courses and learned about Google API key for creating web maps. I also studied website design templates. I believe this comprehensive understanding of the sub-theme could be helpful for our group assignment.

#Estimated Time
I spent approximately 4 hours of personal time this week studying this sub-theme, including the time spent on the assignment.
#Insights on Content
The HTML theme provided an introductory foundation for creating websites. It helped me gain basic knowledge instead of starting from scratch. I also gained confidence in working with HTML through this week's learning. I learned how to use a Google API key to create maps in HTML and explored website templates. Overall, it reinforced my knowledge from previous learning courses on this language.
#Insights on Career/Employment/Learning
After completing the practical exercises, I started watching YouTube courses on the topic to see if they provided additional insights that I didn't gain from the practical exercises alone. I did learn some advanced CSS concepts that I hadn't covered in web design, which could be useful for creating more refined details when building websites in the future. Based on my learning strategy this week, I concluded that this approach of reading guides, doing practical exercises, and then revisiting tutorials is effective for me. However, I need more practice and should search for additional resources rather than relying solely on watching videos for understanding.
